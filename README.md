# Django_ML_Models: Deploy Machine Learning Model Using Django Framework


- Summary: using red wine datasets, we use Random Forest to predict the quality of wine, the main focus is to build ML in Django hence please dont judge me if the model is inefficient, I just use simple train_test_split and RFC() without fine-tuning anything

- Datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

- Inside: 
   - hello folder: contains user interface and model implementation
   - mysite folder: backbone
   - finalized_model.sav : model trained with the mentioned dataset by RandomForestClassifier()
